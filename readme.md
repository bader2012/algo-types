# TypeScript Algorithms

This repository contains a collection of various algorithms implemented in TypeScript. The algorithms are designed to demonstrate common data structures and algorithmic techniques such as sorting, searching, graph traversal, and more. Each file represents an individual algorithm with its corresponding logic.

## Algorithms

1. **Binary Search** - `binary_search.ts`  
   An efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list of items.
2. **Breadth First Search (BFS)** - `breadth_first_search.ts`  
   A graph traversal algorithm that explores neighbors level by level.

3. **Bubble Sort** - `bubble_sort.ts`  
   A simple sorting algorithm that compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

4. **Depth First Search (DFS)** - `depth_first_search.ts`  
   A graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

5. **Dijkstra's Algorithm** - `dijkstra.ts`  
   An algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph.

6. **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm** - `floyd_warshall.ts`  
   A dynamic programming algorithm for finding shortest paths in a weighted graph with positive or negative edge weights.

7. **In-Order Traversal** - `in_order_traversal.ts`  
   A tree traversal algorithm that visits the left branch, the node, and then the right branch.

8. **Kruskal's Algorithm** - `kruskal.ts`  
   An algorithm for finding the minimum spanning tree of a graph.

9. **Merge Sort** - `merge_sort.ts`  
   A divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that divides the array into halves, sorts them, and merges the results.

10. **Post-Order Traversal** - `post_order_traversal.ts`  
    A tree traversal algorithm that visits the left branch, the right branch, and then the node.

11. **Pre-Order Traversal** - `pre_order_traversal.ts`  
    A tree traversal algorithm that visits the node, the left branch, and then the right branch.

12. **Prim's Algorithm** - `prim.ts`  
    An algorithm for finding the minimum spanning tree of a graph.

13. **Quick Sort** - `quick_sort.ts`  
    A divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that selects a pivot element and partitions the array into elements less than and greater than the pivot.

14. **Topological Sort** - `topological_sort.ts`  
    A linear ordering of vertices in a directed acyclic graph (DAG).

15. **Union-Find (Disjoint Set)** - `union_find.ts`  
    A data structure for managing a collection of disjoint sets, supporting efficient union and find operations.

## Setup

To use the algorithms in this repository:

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ts-algorithms.git
   Navigate to the project directory:
   cd ts-algorithms
   Install the necessary dependencies (if needed):
